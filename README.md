# IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY

This is a project that me and my classmates developed as a MINI PROJECT for academics.
The project is built using python.

•	In this project we primarily concentrated on the data security issues when sending the data over the network using steganographic techniques.
•	The main objectives of our project are to product security tool based on steganography techniques to hider message carried by stego-media which should not be sensible to human beings and avoid drawing suspicion to the existence of hidden message


Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone can not know the presence or contents of the hidden message. The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties.

You can check out the detailed information in the documentation part.
